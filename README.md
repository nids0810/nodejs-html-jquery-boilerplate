# Node JS HTML JQuery Boilerplate #

Use this teamplate as a boilerplate to build a dynamic HTML website using Node.js, Javascript, Jquery and scss using the Parcel builder in just five simple steps.

1. Clone the git repo. This will add all the necesary files including the website file under `src` folder
```
git clone https://github.com/vipl0ve/nodejs-html-jquery-boilerplate.git
cd nodejs-html-jquery-boilerplate
```
2. Run Yarn to install all dependencies
```
yarn
```
3. Build the website using `yarn build`. This should create a `dest` folder and all projects files dynamically 
```
yarn build
```
4. Create server. This will create a localserver to host the website. This will also watch and update any changes made in the src folder.
```
yarn watch
```
5. Open the localhost mentioned in the termial to view the website live.
